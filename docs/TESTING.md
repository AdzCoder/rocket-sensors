# Testing Documentation

## Component Tests

### Accelerometer
- Verified with pendulum test
- Expected sine wave pattern observed
- Calibrated to read 0 at rest

### Pressure Sensor
- Tested in pressure chamber
- Compared against calibrated reference
- Accurate within 5% of reference values

### Temperature Sensor
- Showed response to heat changes
- Readings were erratic in final assembly
- Suspected interference or connection issues

## System Tests

### Lift Test
- Simulated rocket flight in building elevator
- Recorded:
  - Max height: 16.3m
  - Max acceleration: 0.74m/sÂ²
  - Flight time: 19.8s
- Buzzer activated correctly when conditions met

## Data Validation

Sample data from lift test:

![Lift Test Data](lift-test-data.png)

- Pressure changes correlated with height changes
- Acceleration spikes matched elevator movements
- Temperature data unreliable
